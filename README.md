This repository includes the complete DADA2 pipeline for the analysis of 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing.
The script mostly follows the DADA2 tutorial, with some tweaking the existing script which works on R 4.0.3
The example data set used here is Pumice rock sample and negative control 16s rRNA sequences

Included in this repository are...
ASV_DADA2Pumice.RMD (R markdown file to run analyses and generate figures)
